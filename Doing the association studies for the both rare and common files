For doing the rare and common variant association study, we first used the master VCF files called as Raw.Vcf 
For this original file we divided the variaint files into 2 groups called as common and rare vcf files and did the manipulation for the single variant assocaiation for the common variant and subsequenty planned to do the gene based test on the rare variant of the gene sets. 

## Part 1: Extracting the VCF files from the orignal raw files
First I made a new folder called Common_rare in the path 

/proj/b2012058/nobackup/private/sailen/

And copied the file raw.vcf into it

cp raw.vcf Common_rare/

Now we the master VCF files contain samples that were unusable as from the mapping and subsequent preprocessing steps. We knew that there were some samples that had some problem with either the variants being low thorughput or with the samples are out of cluster from IBS plot (Contact Benjamin with the clustering plot). Thus, we only took the samples that had the high basecalls and grouped together so as to make their ethinic background same. For this we used the tools VCFtools. The samples in consideration were given a file name sample_remove and contains the sample names in the new files as
 
head sample_remove
S0328
S0664
S0580
S0922
S1056

For the common variants I selected the MAF 0.01 as the base line above which all the variants are selected while for the rare or
in my opinion to take into the complete mutation profile such that even 1 allele has the variant, I took the MAF as 0.005. Now using the vcfools commands we get the following rare and common list variants from the raw vcf master files

 vcftools --vcf raw.vcf --remove sample_remove --remove-filtered-all --maf 0.01 --max-missing 0.95 --recode --out Common
 vcftools --vcf raw.vcf --remove sample_remove --remove-filtered-all --maf 0.005 --max-missing 0.95 --recode --out Rare
 ## THIS command did take a lot of time 
 
Now we have the vcf file as Common.recode.vcf and Rare.recode.vcf and using the wc -l command in the each vcf file I get the following count of the vcf files

Common = 74525 out of a possible 211467 Sites , 211 samples
Rare = 87477 out of a possible 211467 Sites, 211 sample

(See log files for the more information about the command and the output)

Now having the two VCF files we proceed with the Single variant association and rare variant assocaition. For this I thought to use single variant association SNPs with the p value < 10-4 and mapping these variants into genes. These genes are then tested for the rare varaiant association. Does that make sense???

## Part -2
 module load plinkseq
 
 Making the proj files helps in the manipulation and managment of the vcf tools. Hence I created the project file into the plinkseq
