## Object-oriented programming from Data Camp

#### Lecture -1  What is Objected - Oriented Programming(OOP)
Most of the data analysis so far has been dused for functional programming that means we use a function in adataset to get a new data which is further manipulated. However, in the object oriented programming thr focus is now shifted to how the complex objects are manipulated in progrmamming. The lecturere has tried to explain this concept using packages sucha as biocinductor where the main focus is representing limited genomic features, secondly with APIs such as webbased application such as facebook and twitter we want to created tool for better data visulaization , and lastly with shy application in R we can create a new we based application for the data.

Some application for OOP could be :
** Writing an interface to the Internet Movie Database API.
** Creating objects to work with cartographic data for spatial analysis

Thus, it can be said that OOP is suitable for workflows where you can describe a limited number of objects.
